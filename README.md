## About
​
The Commodity Investment Analyzer is a data-driven tool designed to assist investors in making informed decisions about investing in various commodities. Leveraging historical data and advanced analytical techniques, the tool aims to answer critical questions and provide insights into the performance of different commodities.Features and Components:

Data Collection: The tool will collect historical data for a selected list of commodities, including Physical Gold, Physical Silver, Real Estate prices (Average Sale price), SPY, Nasdaq, Bitcoin, and ETH, through APIs such as yfinance. This data will serve as the foundation for analysis.

Percentile Change Comparison: The tool will calculate and compare the percentile change in the prices of these commodities over time, allowing users to identify trends and patterns.

Monte Carlo Simulations: Monte Carlo simulations will be employed to simulate various investment scenarios. Users can input their investment amounts and timeframes, and the tool will provide probabilistic forecasts for potential growth.

Visualization: Matplotlib, Hvplot, and Geoviews will be used to create interactive and informative visualizations. This will include line charts, heatmaps, and geographical representations to make complex data more accessible.

Pandas Data Analysis: Pandas will be utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis to answer research questions and provide relevant insights.

API Integration: Data will be continuously updated via APIs to ensure that the tool provides real-time information for decision-making.
